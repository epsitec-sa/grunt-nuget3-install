# grunt-nuget3-install

> Nuget (v3.3) C# solution install packages.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.2`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-nuget3-install --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-nuget3-install');
```

## The "nuget_install" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `nuget_install` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  nuget_install: {
    file: 'Client.Project.sln',
  },
});
```
